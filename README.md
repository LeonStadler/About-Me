# Hi, I'm Leon Stadler 👋
### Communication & Multimedia Designer • Digital Experience Design • AI‑Supported Automation

I’m a multidisciplinary **communication and multimedia designer** working with a strong focus on **digital design, design thinking, and AI‑supported solutions**. I grew up in Munich and am now based in Lindau am Bodensee, operating at the intersection of **design, technology, and organizational practice**. My aim is to translate complex contexts into coherent brands, usable products, and digital experiences that are functional, accessible, and culturally meaningful.

After completing a B.A. and M.A. in Arts & Design (Intermedia) at FH Vorarlberg, I developed a practice that deliberately moves across media and levels of abstraction — from research and conceptual framing to system design, high‑fidelity execution, and implementation. I value solutions that are intuitive in use, formally precise, and resilient in real‑world conditions.

My interests center on human‑centered digital products, open‑source culture, AI‑driven automation, and web experiences that combine clarity with narrative strength. Currently, I’m deepening my understanding of agent/RAG architectures, scalable SaaS patterns, and motion‑based interface design.

## Areas of practice

### Design & Creative Direction
- Creative experience design and management
- Human‑centered design, UX/UI
- Branding, corporate design, art direction
- Communication design across **digital, analog, and print** media
- Photography, film, motion design, and interactive media
- Concept development for games and immersive experiences

### Web & Product Frontend
- Web design from strategy to launch (especially WordPress and open stacks)
- Design systems, component logic, and token‑based styling
- Interactive, motion‑driven interfaces
- Frontend implementation with React / Next.js / TypeScript

## Current focus / projects
- **Scale Up** — an AI and automation company I’m co‑founding with **Maik Bierman**. We develop tailored automations and bots/agents, and provide consulting and training.
- **Scale Hub** — our modular SaaS platform within Scale Up (CRM, support, documents, agent/bot automation).
- **Chat Up** — a Scale Hub product/feature: a RAG‑powered website chat that turns organizational knowledge into useful conversations.
- **Greifbar Bregenz** — Team Lead for Marketing & Digital Design, plus designer/web designer and hands‑on all‑rounder in the day‑to‑day life of the gym.
- **Web design & corporate projects** — ongoing client work on websites, identities, campaigns, and communication systems.

### Design & Media
- Adobe Creative Suite, Affinity
- Figma / Sketch
- Final Cut
- End‑to‑end workflows for photo, video, motion, and print

### Web Design / Platforms
- WordPress (preferred), Webflow, Framer, Wix
- Strong orientation toward **open‑source stacks** and maintainable long‑term builds
- Contributor/translator in community projects whenever possible

### Frontend
- React / Next.js / TypeScript
- Tailwind, GSAP, Framer Motion
- Systematic UI, design tokens, reusable components

### Backend / Data (when needed)
- PostgreSQL and relational data modeling
- Foundations of RAG and vector search
- API design and automation orchestration

## Working approach
I begin with people, context, and constraints, and only then move into form‑giving. By clarifying the underlying problem first, I can translate insights into a consistent design language: systems and relationships before surface decisions. I prototype early to test direction, interaction, and tone, then iterate quickly while refining details with care. Each visual and technical choice should have a clear purpose — guiding attention, reducing friction, or strengthening the narrative of a product or brand. Because I also implement frontends (and occasionally the data layer), I can carry concepts into production without losing intent. Open source is important to me as a counterbalance to big‑tech consolidation, so I try to build in ways that can be shared, reused, and contributed back to the wider ecosystem.

## Outside of work
You’ll usually find me doing **calisthenics, bouldering/climbing, or windsurfing**. Sport keeps me grounded and informs how I think about dynamics, flow, and collaboration — qualities I also look for in digital experiences.

---

## Open to
- Website projects and digital products
- UX/UI, branding, and corporate design
- Photo/video, motion, and interactive media work
- Collaboration with agencies, product teams, and founders

If a project benefits from **design and development as one integrated craft**, I’m interested.

Fun fact: I’m equally happy tuning a type scale, refactoring a React component, or dialing in the perfect espresso.
